## Description

This webpage was created for our bootcamp's first project. This will showcase our acquired skills and knowledge to build a web application from scratch. Our focus is to execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from mutliple server-side API requests.

This project was created using agile development methodologies and implementation of feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.
